Antipodes lets the users visualize their current location as well as their antipodes location in the world. The idea is that, at any given moment the user is able to see where he is located using a map provided by Google Maps and be able to toggle the view and visualize the same kind of information for the antipodes location in the world, i.e. the place on Earth's surface which is diametrically opposite to the current location. More information from other services is included such as the times for sunrise and sunset for the current date provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (DNMI) as well as geolocated pictures from Flickr.

Some of the web services that are in use are:
* Google Maps (on the client)
* Norwegian Meteorological Institute, DNMI (Proxied via the server)
* Flickr (Proxied via Yahoo YQL)
